# Simulation of VANET using AODV Protocol with Omnet++

*Project related to the '**Network Security**' exam @ **University of Calabria.***   
***TEAM MEMBERS:** Alessandro Viscomi, Alessia Ramogida, Gianluca Massara*

The project involves the study of **Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs)** and the analysis of security aspects related to these networks and the **Ad-hoc On-Demand Vector (AODV)** routing protocol used within them. For this purpose, the **Omnet++** development environment was employed to conduct simulations.

The main objective of this project was to identify vulnerabilities within VANETs by executing attacks on the network. Subsequently, the implementation of defense measures to protect the network from such attacks was carried out.

The implemented attacks include:

- Black Hole
- RREQ Flooding
- ARP Poisoning

As previously mentioned, countermeasures were implemented for each of these attacks to protect against them.
